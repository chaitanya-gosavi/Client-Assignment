## ‚ö° Getting Started

### 1. Clone the Repository
```
git clone <your-repo-url>
cd <project-folder>
```

### 2. Database Setup (MySQL)
- Open MySQL Workbench or your preferred client.
- Run the SQL script:
  - Open `Client/rural_platform.sql`
  - Execute all to create the database, tables, and sample data.

### 3. Backend Setup
```
cd backend
npm install
```
- Create a `.env` file in `backend/`:
```
PORT=5000
DB_HOST=localhost
DB_USER=your_mysql_user
DB_PASSWORD=your_mysql_password
DB_NAME=rural_platform
JWT_SECRET=your_jwt_secret
```
- Start the server:
```
node index.js
```

### 4. Frontend Setup
- Open `Client/index.html` in your browser (double-click or drag into browser).
- For real API usage, update `script.js` to use backend endpoints instead of localStorage.
